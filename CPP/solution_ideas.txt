GENERAL:
 - Try binary/ternary searching the answer.
 - You can try to map anything to graphs. Intersection of things, grouping of stuff, etc. Geometry to graphs is specially useful.

GRAPHS:
 - Amount of paths of length 'k' can be calculated by raising the adjacency matrix to the kth power.

GREEDY:
 - Several greedy "grabbing" problems can be done with a priority queue. Keep grabbing or swap current with the worst
 you have already grabbed.
 
DP:
 - Try sorting something before doing the recursion.
 - Stablish the opposite order DP (instead of minimum time to grab n objects, maximum objects grabbable with t time).

STRINGS:
 - Anything related with string lexicographic order can probably be done with a Suffix Array. If it has comparison
 between two strings, you can even consider building a suffix array from the concatenation of the two strings.

MATH:
 - If you have to solve an equation, you will very probably have to brute force the variables. Try to find if any
 variable divides another (so you brute force only through the divisors of the other)
